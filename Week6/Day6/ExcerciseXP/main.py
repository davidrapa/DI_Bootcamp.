# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Convert Lists Into Dictionaries
# Instructions
# Convert the two following lists, into dictionaries.
# Hint: Use the zip method
# keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
# values = [10, 20, 30]
# Expected output:
# {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

valkey = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(valkey)

# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Cinemax
# Instructions
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
# if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.
#
# Given the following object:
#
# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}
#
#
# How much does each family member have to pay ?
#
# Print out the familyâ€™s total cost for the movies.
# Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).
